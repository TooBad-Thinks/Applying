## Introduction

Welcome and thank you for your interesting Japanese Translation for CRTL + Z Scans!

**Translation** is arguably the most important role in scanlation. The entire quality of a chapter relies on how accurate the translator interprets the Japanese text and into phrases and sentences that would make sense in English.

While experience with translation is not necessary, sufficient knowledge in the fundamentals is important. This means knowledge of the basics scripts and how they're written, era-appropriate slang, and neologisms for **both** languages. This allows translators to properly read even messy handwriting, understand how the young'uns talk nowadays, and figure out which words fit best.

We *highly recommend* reading the guides and resources below (assuming you are already familiar with Japanese and English) before starting with the test to get cozy with how translation for scanlation is often done.
