## Introduction

Welcome and thank you for your interest in typesetting for CRTL + Z Scans!

**Typesetting** is one of the core roles in scanlation and is *very important* to get right! As such, we'd love for you to *thoroughly read this guide* as it will walk you through the process of studying typesetting guides, doing the required test/s, and actually applying.

Before anything else, it is *very important* that you make an effort to skim or review on current typesetting norms.

We *highly recommend* reading [yours' Guide to Typesetting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ss6AW07S8onlS1-SbgyoF4w1ve285B2fVqsgOtkKuLk/edit?usp=sharing) before attempting the test. **Everything you need to do regarding typesetting is comprehensively explained in it.** The things we look for when considering applicants is also detailed in the guide and most of our feedback will be pointing out deficiencies in the fundamentals.


## Taking the Test

To begin the test, just let the tester know you're ready by saying "Done".
Once you do, the tester will send over the files you need.

That’s it, no hunting for folders or links.
We’ll walk you through everything step-by-step once you're in.
